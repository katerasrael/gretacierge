    -c, --config CONFIG                      Path to the catcierge config file. Catcierge looks for /etc/catcierge/catcierge.cfg by default, unless
                                             --no_default_config has been specified. Setting this overrides the default config.
                                             NOTE: Options for the raspberry pi camera settings --rpi, cannot be used in this config. Please see
                                             --config_rpi and --camhelp for details.
    --config_rpi CONFIG_RPI                  Path to config file for raspberry pi camera settings. See --camhelp for details. Default location:
                                             /etc/catcierge/catcierge-rpi.cfg
    --no_default_config                      Do not load the default config (/etc/catcierge/catcierge.cfg) if none is specified using --config
    --chuid CHUID                            Run the process under this user when dropping root privileges which are needed for setting GPIO pins on
                                             the Raspberry Pi.
    --base_time BASE_TIME                    The base date time we should use instead of the current time. Only meant to be used when testing the code
                                             to have a repeatable time for replaying events.
    --camhelp                                Show extra raspberry pi camera help
    --non_rpi_cam                            Don't attempt to use the onboard RPI camera. Instead let OpenCV search for the camera. Use this if you
                                             want to use a USB webcam instead. (On other platforms than Raspberry Pi this is default)
    --camera_index CAMERA_INDEX              Zero-based index of the camera to use. Default value is 0.
                                             (Note that this setting does nothing when using the built-in Raspberry Pi camera).

Region Of Interest (ROI) settings:
  If the backlight does not take up the entire camera image, these settings can be used to set what part of the image that the matcher should look for
  the cat head in. The region of interest (ROI).

    --startup_delay STARTUP_DELAY            Number of seconds to wait after starting before starting to capture anything. This is so that if you have
                                             a back light that is turned on at startup, it has time to turn on, otherwise the program will think
                                             something is obstructing the image and start trying to match.
    --roi X Y WIDTH HEIGHT                   Crop all input image to this region of interest. Cannot be used together with --auto_roi.
    --auto_roi                               Automatically crop to the area covered by the backlight. This will be done after --startup_delay has
                                             ended. Cannot be used together with --roi.
    --auto_roi_thr THRESHOLD                 Set the threshold values used to find the backlight, using a binary threshold algorithm. Separate each
                                             pixel into either black or white. White if the greyscale value of the pixel is above the threshold, and
                                             black otherwise.
                                             Default value 90
    --min_backlight MIN_BACKLIGHT            If --auto_roi is on, this sets the minimum allowed area the backlight is allowed to be before it is
                                             considered broken. If it is smaller than this, the program will exit. Default 10000.
    --save_auto_roi                          Save the image roi found by --auto_roi. Can be useful for debugging when tweaking the threshold. Result
                                             placed in --output_path.

Matcher settings:
    --templ, --template, --template_matcher  Template based matching algorithm.
    --haar, --haar_matcher                   Haar feature based matching algorithm (recommended).
    --ok_matches_needed OK_MATCHES_NEEDED    The number of matches out of 4 matches that need to be OK for the match to be considered an over all OK
                                             match.
    --no_final_decision                      Normally after all matches in a match group has been made the matcher algorithm gets to do a final
                                             decision based on the entire group of matches which overrides the "--ok_matches_needed"setting. This flag
                                             turns this behavior off.
    --matchtime MATCHTIME                    The time to wait after a match before attemping again. Default 0 seconds.

Haar cascade matcher settings:
  Settings for when --haar_matcher is used.
  This is the recommended matcher type.

    --cascade CASCADE                        Path to the haar cascade xml generated by opencv_traincascade.
    --in_direction LEFT|RIGHT                The direction which is considered going inside.
    --min_size MIN_SIZE                      The size of the minimum sized box that fits the matched cat head.
    --no_match_is_fail                       If no cat head is found in the picture, consider this a failure. The default is to only consider found
                                             prey a failure.
    --eqhist, --equalize_histogram           Equalize the histogram of the image before doing. the haar cascade detection step.
    --prey_steps 1|2                         Only applicable for normal prey mode. 2 means a secondary search should be made if no prey is found
                                             initially.
    --prey_method ADAPTIVE|NORMAL            Sets the prey matching method. Adaptive combines the result of both a global and adaptive thresholding to
                                             be better able to find prey parts otherwise blended into the background. Normal is simpler and doesn't
                                             catch such corner cases as well.

Template matcher settings:
  Settings for when --template_matcher is used.
  Note that it is recommended you use the --haar_matcher instead.

    --snout SNOUT [SNOUT ...]                Path to the snout images to use. If more than one path is given, the average match result is used.
    --threshold THRESHOLD                    Match threshold as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Default 0.8
    --match_flipped                          Match a flipped version of the snout (don't consider going out a failed match). Default on.

Lockout settings:
  These settings control how the cat door will be locked.

    --lockout_method LOCKOUT_METHOD          Defines the method used to decide when to unlock:
                                             [1: Only use the timer, don't care about clear frame.]
                                             2: Wait for clear frame or that the timer has timed out.
                                             3: Wait for clear frame and then start unlock timer.
    --lockout LOCKOUT                        The time in seconds a lockout takes. Default 30 seconds.
    --no_unlock_after_lockout NO_UNLOCK_AFTER_LOC
                                             The default behavior is that the cat door is always open, and when a prey is detected, the door is locked
                                             for a set time (set by --lockout), and then unlocked.
                                             However this is a problem if you are overriding the normal lockout mechanism for example if you want to
                                             reverse that behavior, so that the cat door is normally closed and only opens if the cat has no prey.
                                             Use this option so if a prey is detected, we never unlock. Not until a good match has been made again.
    --lockout_error LOCKOUT_ERROR            Number of lockouts in a row that's allowed before we consider it an error and quit the program. Default is
                                             to never do this.
    --lockout_error_delay LOCKOUT_ERROR_DELAY
                                             The delay in seconds between lockouts that should be counted as a consecutive lockout. Default 3.0.
    --lockout_dummy                          Do everything as normal, but don't actually lock the door. This is useful for testing.

Raspberry Pi GPIO settings:
  Settings for changing the GPIO pins used on the Raspberry Pi.
  Note that if you change these, you will need to set the same pin in the init script so the pin gets the correct state at boot. For permanently
  changing this, it's instead recommended that you change the default pin when compiling.

    --lockout_gpio_pin GPIO                  Change the Raspberry Pi GPIO pin used for triggering the lockout of the cat door.
                                             The default GPIO pin used: 4
    --backlight_gpio_pin GPIO                Change the Raspberry Pi GPIO pin used for turning on the backlight (if backlight control is enabled --backlight_enable).
                                             The default GPIO pin used: 18
    --backlight_enable                       Control the backlight via a GPIO pin? This will then always turn it on at startup. If you instead have the
                                             backlight wired to always be on, this is not needed.

Presentation settings:
    --show                                   Show GUI of the camera feed (X11 only).
    --highlight                              Highlight the best match on saved images. (Only ever use for debugging purposes, since it writes on the
                                             original image)
    --nocolor                                Turn off all color output in the console.
    --noanim                                 Turn off animations in the console.

Output settings:
  Note that all the *_path variables below can contain variables of the format %var%.
  See --cmdhelp for available variables, and --eventhelp for a list of events.

    --eventhelp                              Show a list of the events that are triggered by catcierge. Templates specified using --input can filter
                                             based on these so that they generate output only for a specific event. This also shows general help
                                             regarding input template settings.
    --save                                   Save match images (both ok and failed).
    --save_obstruct                          Save the image that triggered the "frame obstructed" event.
    --save_steps                             Save each step of the matching algorithm. (--save must also be turned on)
    --input INPUT [INPUT ...]                Path to one or more template files generated on specified events. (Not to be confused with the template
                                             matcher). See --eventhelp for details on generating these on specific events as well as input template
                                             settings.
    --output, --output_path PATH             Path to where the match images and generated templates should be saved.
    --match_output_path PATH                 Override --output_path for match images and save them here instead. This can be relative to --output_path
                                             by using %%output_path%% in the path. Note that this applies to all paths, other path variables can be
                                             used to create a nested structure. Just make sure you do not add a recursive dependence. Also any other
                                             %%vars%% can of course be used to build the path. See --cmdhelp for details.
    --steps_output_path PATH                 If --save_steps is enabled, save step images to this path. Same as for --match_output_path, overrides --output_path.
                                             Example: --steps_output_path %%match_output_path%%/steps
    --obstruct_output_path PATH              Path for the obstruct images. Overrides --output_path.
    --template_output_path PATH              Output path for templates (given by --template). Overrides --output_path.

Command settings:
  These are commands that will be executed when certain events occur.
  Variables can be passed to these commands such as:
    %state%, %match_success% and so on.
  To see a list of variables use --cmdhelp

    --cmdhelp                                Shows command output variable help.
    --match_group_done_cmd CMD [CMD ...]     Command to run when the match_group_done event is triggered. Event when all steps for match group has been
                                             successfully performed. This is most likely what you want to trigger most stuff on.
    --state_change_cmd CMD [CMD ...]         Command to run when the state_change event is triggered. State machine state changed.
    --do_lockout_cmd CMD [CMD ...]           Command to run when the do_lockout event is triggered. Triggered right before a lockout is performed.
    --do_unlock_cmd CMD [CMD ...]            Command to run when the do_unlock event is triggered. Triggered right before a unlock is performed.
    --save_img_cmd CMD [CMD ...]             Command to run when the save_img event is triggered. Event after all images for a match group have been
                                             saved to disk.
    --match_done_cmd CMD [CMD ...]           Command to run when the match_done event is triggered. Triggered after each match in a match group.
    --frame_obstructed_cmd CMD [CMD ...]     Command to run when the frame_obstructed event is triggered. Right after the camera view has been
                                             obstructed and the obstruct image has been saved.
    -u, --uservar USERVAR [USERVAR ...]      Adds a user defined variable that can then be used when generating templates or executing custom commands.
                                             This is useful when passing passwords or similar, so those don't have to be defined in the script but
                                             when catcierge is started instead. And can then also be used in multiple places.

Signal settings:
  The program can receive signals that can be sent using the kill command.
    SIGUSR1
    SIGUSR2
  These settings can be used to customize what happens when catcierge receives these signals.
  Available behaviors:
    none = Nothing is peformed
    lock = Lock the cat door for lockout time
    unlock = Unlock the cat door
    ignore = Ignores any events, until 'attention'
    attention = Stops ignoring events

    --sigusr1 SIGUSR1                        Set the behavior when the SIGUSR1 signal is received.
    --sigusr2 SIGUSR2                        Set the behavior when the SIGUSR2 signal is received.
